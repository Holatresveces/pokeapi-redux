## üìù Notes

As this application deals mostly with API calls, a better-suited tool for this kind of application is [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview), which abstracts away much of the state management related to data fetching and also provides caching features. For the purpose of this exercise, a conscious decision was made to use only the features provided by [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), as I think it should convey a better understanding of the Redux data flow and patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Future Improvements

Due to time constraints, the mandatory features for this exercise, as per the requirement, were completed. However, these are some tasks that would further improve the application:

- **Testing**: Add integration and unit tests using React Testing Library.
- **Caching**: Since we can end up having repeated API calls to get the same data, I would use RTK Query to deal with caching, which should result in better performance and ultimately a better experience for the user.
- **Error handling**: Features stick mostly to the happy path. A 'failed' status is kept in state if one of the API calls returns an error. However, there's currently no indication of this to the user, who should currently see a screen with empty data. A better approach would be adding an error message with a button to retry the action.
- **Pagination**: Pagination is currently being managed internally by the appication's state. It would be nice to keep it in sync with a query param so that the user is able to navigate to a particular page on the list given a query param on the URL.
